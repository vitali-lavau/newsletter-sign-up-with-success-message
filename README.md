# Newsletter Sign-Up Form â€” Frontend Mentor

## Description

This project is a solution for the [Frontend Mentor | Newsletter sign-up form with success message](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv) challenge.

The goal was to build a responsive, accessible newsletter sign-up form as close as possible to the original design. The project uses semantic HTML, SCSS (with variables and BEM methodology), and the Roboto font from Google Fonts. The layout and assets are fully responsive for all device sizes. Form validation and success state are handled in vanilla JavaScript.
